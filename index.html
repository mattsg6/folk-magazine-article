<h2 class="subhead">William B. Umstead State Park</h2>

<p>The Research Triangle Park in central North Carolina is known for the many tech companies and businesses that support the ever-growing local economy; however, it’s also home to William B. Umstead State Park, a 5,000-acre park that boasts numerous trails, a lake, camping grounds, and more. Whether you’re just tired from a busy work day or you’re an outdoor enthusiast looking for an adventure, Umstead State Park is the place for you.</p>
<p>There’s something for everyone at this park and this list will help you plan the perfect trip. Let’s explore the best things to do at Umstead State Park:</p>

<h2>Traverse The Trails</h2>

<p>Umstead State Park has many trails that are great for hiking, biking, running, walking, and — on occasion — horseback riding. These trails provide the perfect reprieve from the bustling local industries, as the trees and wildlife envelope you in nature.</p>
<p>There are two entry points to access the trails: Crabtree Creek and Reedy Creek. The former is off of Glenwood Avenue and the latter is off of Harrison Avenue.</p>
<p>These extensive trails are great for everyone—whether you’re a marathon runner training to build endurance or a family going for a serendipitous walk through nature. Umstead State Park has the right trail for you!</p>
<p>For more information on the trails or to access maps for visiting, visit the <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/william-b-umstead-state-park/trails">North Carolina Parks website</a>.</p>

<h2>Get in the Water</h2>

<p>Water enthusiasts can enjoy a variety of activities by visiting one of the park’s three lakes—Big Lake, Sycamore Lake, and Reedy Creek Lake—and fishing fanatics can cast their lines in many of the connecting streams.</p>
<p>If you’re not much of an angler but still want to splash around in the water, you can also rent a canoe or paddle boat and take it out onto the lake. Unfortunately, this is as close as you can get to the water, as no swimming is allowed. Luckily, many of the trails pass right by these lakes and streams so you can enjoy the water easily and safely.</p>
<p>Beware! The nearby Wake Stone rock quarry is known to deposit residual runoff into the streams, so do your best to avoid the dangerous particles when fishing or enjoying the water. This harmful effect (for both the ecosystems within the streams and those who enjoy the water) may be worsened in the coming years if the proposed expansion lease is allowed, but locals are hard at work to make sure it is not!</p>
<p>Also, be sure to abide by any applicable rules and regulations when it comes to water activities. More information about enjoying —a nd staying aware about — the water at Umstead State Park can be found at the <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/about-us/nc-state-parks-rules-and-regulations#Boatingandfishing-460">North Carolina Parks website</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay for a While</h2>

<p>If you’re having an amazing time at Umstead State Park, maybe you want to spend the night. There are several campgrounds that nature lovers can rent which come with accommodations including pavilions, showers, and fire wood.</p>
<p>For the less intrepid, a simple picnic may be preferred in which case there are many picnic tables and coverings where you can enjoy a meal.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may be able to participate in a community hike, race, or protest held at the park if you’re in town at the right time. These events and civic activities help to foster community relationships and for locals to express their appreciation for the park. To stay up on events at Umstead, visit the <a href="https://umsteadcoalition.org/Calendar/">events page</a></p>
<p>Try to avoid these activities on blasting days at the quarry though. Local residents know all too well how these unsettling blasts—not to even mention the dangerous particles that linger in the air, which is a potential health risk—can interrupt a peaceful day. You never know when there may be a blast, so stay safe and vigilant. Hopefully these blasts will come to an end soon when the quarry’s lease runs up, but it may be some time longer if the expansion is allowed. This decision is all dependent on some upcoming decisions in governing bodies. Keep reading to learn more and see how you can contribute!</p>

<h2>Quick Trips and Tips</h2>

<p>If you’re short on time, but still want to interact with the park, these Quick Trips and Tips will allow you to do just that. Every day at the park offers a reminder that we live in an interconnected world. Our actions as humans can influence the places we visit and the places can influence us. Umstead State Park offers visitors several quick ways to see the long effects of our relationship to the places we live, whether through art or even through intense extraction for momentary profit. Check out the examples below to learn more!</p>

<b>Chainsaw Art</b>
<p>Creativity knows no bounds, and this beautifully-carved tree at Umstead State Park serves as evidence of how art and nature come together. Chainsaw carvers Jerry Reid and Randy Boni decided to transform a downed tree, and the result is astonishing. Rather than viewing the tree as an obstacle, the artists saw it as a canvas on which they painted a stunning image.</p>

<b>The Hole</b>
<p>While you can’t actually visit the quarry, you may be able to hear or sneak a peek at the large extraction site that has appeared as a result of Wake Stone’s operation that sits very close to the park (the parking lot can be seen in the upper left hand corner of the image!). This dangerous hole will only get bigger if local governing bodies decide Wake Stone can expand their project. The Conservation Fund (an environmental non-profit), however, wants to buy the land and merge it with Umstead State Park, which is what many local residents wish for as well. Whether you want to learn more about the hole or even help locals in their effort to extend the park rather than the quarry, keep reading!</p>

<b>The Umstead Coalition</b>
<p>To make sure these places best serve the needs of the people, every park needs a steward and the volunteer-led Umstead Coalition is just that. This organization holds events, puts together projects, and serves the community. One of their most recent endeavors is fighting against the Wake Stone Corporation as they attempt to expand their current quarry. These quarries damage the land and health of the environment all in the name of profit. This circumstance is one of the many instances in which a choice is being made for the future of the natural world: we can let industry, pollution, and greed prevail; or we can stand up to corporate-driven climate change. Local residents want to protect this land not only to begin the much needed healing process of the environment, but to extend the park to support the ever-growing and flourishing community.</p>
