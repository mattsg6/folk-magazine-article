<h2 class="subhead">William B. Umstead State Park</h2>

<p>The Research Triangle Park is known for the many tech companies and businesses that support the ever-growing local economy, however, it’s also home to William B. Umstead State Park, a 5,000 acre park that boasts numerous trails, a lake, camping grounds, and more. So if you’re tired from a busy work day or an outdoor enthusiast looking for an adventure, Umstead State Park is the place for you.</p>
<p>There’s something for everyone at this park and this list will help you plan the perfect trip. Let’s explore the best things to do at Umstead State Park:</p>

<h2>Traverse The Trails</h2>

<p>Umstead State Park has many trails that are great for hiking, biking, running, walking, and — on occasion — horseback riding. These trails provide the perfect reprieve from the bustling local industries as the trees and wildlife envelope you in nature.</p>
<p>There are two entry points to access the trails: Crabtree Creek and Reedy Creek. The former is off of Glenwood Ave and the latter is off of Harrison Ave.</p>
<p>These extensive trails are great for a marathon runner training to build endurance or a family going for a serendipitous walk through nature.</p>
<p>For more information on the trails, visit the <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/state-parks/william-b-umstead-state-park/trails">North Carolina Parks website</a>.</p>

<h2>Get in the Water</h2>

<p>There are three lakes — Big Lake, Sycamore Lake, Reedy Creek Late — and many connecting streams from which fishing fanatics can cast their lines. </p>
<p>If you’re not much of an angler, but still want to splash around in the water, then rent a canoe or paddle boat and take it out onto the lake. Unfortunately, this is as close as you can get to the water as no swimming is allowed.</p>
<p>Beware! The nearby Wake Stone rock quarry is known to deposit residual runoff into the streams, so do your best to avoid that when fishing or enjoying the water. This may be worsened in the coming years if the proposed expansion lease is allowed, but locals are hard at work to make sure it is not!</p>
<p>Also, be sure to abide by any applicable rules and regulations when it comes to water activities. More information can be found at the <a href="https://www.ncparks.gov/about-us/nc-state-parks-rules-and-regulations#Boatingandfishing-460">North Carolina Parks website</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay for a While</h2>

<p>If you’re having an amazing time at Umstead State Park, maybe you want to spend the night. There are several campgrounds that nature lovers can rent which come with accommodations including pavilions, showers, and fire wood.</p>
<p>For the less intrepid, a simple picnic may be preferred in which case there are many picnic tables and coverings where you can enjoy a meal.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may be able to participate in a community hike or a race held at the park if you’re in town at the right time.</p>
<p>Try to avoid these activities on blasting days at the quarry. Local residents know all too well how these blasts can interrupt a peaceful day. Not to mention the dangerous particles that linger in the air, causing potential health risks. You never know when there may be a blast so stay safe and vigilant. Hopefully these blasts will come to an end soon when the quarries lease runs up, but it may be some time longer if the expansion is allowed.</p>

<p>If you’re short on time, but still want to interact with the park, these Quick Trips will allow you to do just that.</p>

<b>Chainsaw Art</b>
<p>Creativity knows no bounds and the beautifully carved tree at Umstead State Park serves as evidence. Chainsaw carvers Jerry Reid and Randy Boni decided to transform a downed tree and the result is astonishing.</p>

<b>The Hole</b>
<p>While you can’t actually visit the quarry, you may be able to hear or sneak a peek at the hole that has appeared as a result of the operation. This dangerous hole will only get bigger if local governing bodies decide Wake Stone can expand their project. The Conservation Fund wants to buy the land and merge it with Umstead State Park which is what many local residents wish for as well. If you want to help in this effort, keep reading!</p>

<b>The Umstead Coalition</b>
<p>Every park needs a steward and the volunteer-led Umstead Coalition is just that. This organization holds events, puts together projects, and serves the community. One of their most recent endeavors is fighting against the Wake Stone Corporation as they attempt to expand their current quarry. These quarries damage the land and health of the environment all in the name of profit.
